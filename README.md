Instagrat
=========

A single PHP script that allows Instagram images to be displayed in Twitter Cards

I had this up on instagr.at for a while, all you had to do when sharing from Instagram to Twitter was change the url from instagr.am to instagr.at (Example: instagr.am/123abc changed to instagr.at/123abc). Then your photos would show up in the Twitter feed and if the link was clicked, the user would be redirected to the full Instagram page.

It works by grabbing the open graph meta tags off the Instagram page, then formats them into the Twitter Card meta tags.
